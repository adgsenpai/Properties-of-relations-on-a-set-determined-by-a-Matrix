\subsection{What is a relation?}

A (binary) relation $R$ between sets $A$ and $B$ is a subset of $A \times B$. ($A \times B$ is a Cartesian product.) 

Thus, a relation is a set of pairs. 

The interpretation of this subset is that it contains all the pairs for which the relation is true.  We write $aRb$ if the relation is true for $A$ and $B$ (equivalently $B$, if $(A,B) \in R$). 

$A$ and $B$ can be the same set, in which case the relation is said to be "on" rather than "between":

A binary relation $R$ on a set $A$ is a $\subseteq$ $A \times A$. ($A \times A$ is a Cartesian product.) \\

Example of a relation using $A = \{0,1,2,3\}$ \\

 \begin{math}
    R = \{(0,0),(1,1),(2,2),(3,3)\}  \\
\end{math}

Relations may also be of other arities.  An $n$-ary relation $R$ between sets $X_{1}$, ... , and $X_{n}$ $\subseteq$  $n$-ary product $X_{1}$...$X_{n}$, in which case R is a set of n-tuples.
